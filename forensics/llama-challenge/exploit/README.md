# Llamma Challenge

The challenge can be solved by opening the given `lamma.png`
with a random HexEditor or running on Linux command line 

```shell
hd -c lamma.png
```

After that, it is possible to see that the flag is encoded after the `FF D9` termination bytes.

Finally, you just need to copy and decode it with a Base64 decoder.

> Flag: `SINFCTF2022{d1d_u_s33_lLAmA_bAlLS}`
