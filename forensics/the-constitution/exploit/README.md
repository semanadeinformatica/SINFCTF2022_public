# The Constitution

This is a version of the book code where each line in `guidelines.txt` represents a letter.
You can decode by using the given numbers for the following:
- Article number
- Line number inside the article
- Word number inside the line
- Letter number inside the word
The `{` and `}` are the exception because they don't appear in the constitution.

## Observations

The given constitution has nothing special, it doesn't differ from the official one in any way.
We need to provide it because of the version used.

You can probably automate this but it's doable by hand.
