# One Time Password - Locked

> Note: the `publish/one_time_password_locked` was compiled on the challenge server, whereas the binary executing on the Docker container is compiled on your computer. This means that some values in `solve.py` may vary depending on the binary you use.

Format string vulnerability.

Inspect program symbols via `objdump -t one_time_password` and find the address of the suspicious flag, `service_up`. Use `%n` modifier goodies to fill the flag memory space with some non-zero value.
