# Mr. Nougat's Fried Chicken

This challenge has a few stages. The script under `private/utils/solve.js` sums up how it can be solved.
The planned flow is like this:
- The user needs to insert a specific code to access the flag (their order).
- The player should inspect the source code and realize that 2 scripts are responsible for writing the entire page. The scripts
are encoded.
- To access the real source code, we can either inspect the element (the easy way) or go the long way and decode the scripts by ourselves.
- After analyzing the source code, we need to find a code that validates a hard-coded hash. This can be easily brute-forced using numbers (since it's an order code). However, many codes validate the hash and that is not enough to solve the challenge.
- We can find the real code in many ways. The simplest one is to look for a word like `flag` in the generated secret.
- After inserting the correct password, we are greeted with the flag and a nice KFC bucket!

> Flag: `SINFCTF2022{kfc_is_overrated_lets_stop_obesity}`

## Observations

- The scripts are encoded with base64 (or the weird JS compiler). The second one has an extra layer that uses the `annoyStudent` function. The players can use this function to decode the scripts. If they're smart, they'll just inspect the page's elements and avoid losing time with that.
- After validating the password's hash, the script uses the `elliotCipher()` function to decrypt a hard-coded secret, unveiling a passkey. This key is used to decrypt the flag, which is also encrypted with `elliotCipher()` and stored in `flag.txt`.
