# Ransom Candy

Shell injection vulnerability. The PHP server executes a shell command to check the diff of the user input to the flag. Provide an input that makes the command return success.

Example payload: `any ) || (exit 0`

> Flag: `SINFCTF2022{sh3l1nj3ct1o41Sb2D}`

## Hints

The HTML that the server sends as the POST request response contains a hidden debug div with the command executed server side.
