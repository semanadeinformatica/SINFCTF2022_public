# Candy Tracker


The PHP server validates the 'Add Candy' POST request to check if the new candy's name starts with 'Ni' or 'ni'.

If so, creates a new object of the class `Candy`, serializes it and dispatches it to a different endpoint, with no validation (discoverable via `robots.txt`) which appends the provided name to the file with the provided filename (that defaults to `../candies.txt`). 

The user should post a serialized `Candy` object directly to the second endpoint to modify the PHP code that executes in that route (for example, echoing the flag file contents at the end of the script).

> Flag: `SINFCTF2022{d0n0t3us1tH3Us4r}`

## Hints

The server responds to the add candy POST request with the payload it redirects (or would redirect if validation passed) to the secret API.
